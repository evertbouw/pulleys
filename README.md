# pulleys

Do the heavy lifting with these React hooks!

## installing

`npm i @evertbouw/pulleys` or `yarn add @evertbouw/pulleys`

Comes with typescript definitions.

## idea

When I started to use hooks I quickly saw patterns emerge where I could reuse a lot of my code. I wrote a blog post about this

## api

Browse the source code to see what hooks are available.

## contributing

This project really needs more docs and tests. (and more hooks?) Feel free to open PRs and issues!

## chat

Come hang out in the Reactiflux discord! There isn't a specific channel for this library or even hooks in general.
